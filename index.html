    <h1>What you can use <em>Instead of AI</em></h1>

    <h3>Why not use generative AI?</h3>
    <p>
        Large Laguage Models and other generative AI (GenAI) tech have become seemingly pervasive in the last few years.
        They have been developed to write just about anything and generate images and video. While this may seem like a
        convenience and a productivity tool, they have shown themselves to not really be worth it. Artists, writers,
        programmers have largely found these frustrating because they have led to layoffs, fewer sales, or theft of
        their work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides using much more power than conventional methods to do tasks, GenAI just makes slop. The outputs are
        often not good and need clean up work to make ready for publishing. But even if it was consistently making
        publishable things, the biggest issue still stands:

    <p>
        Making stuff is fun and rewarding, but also often tedious and difficult. The second part is especially true
        when making things for a living. In those cases, commissioning an expert or finding a ready-to-use element can
        accomplish the goal of helping finish the task with less work. Hiring someone can be expensive and even stock
        photos cost some money, but it also means someone gets paid for the work they did to help you finish yours.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you're working on a personal project or just making something because you want it to exist, then the fun
        and rewarding feeling should justify the tedium and difficulty. Putting in the work and practice is very often
        worth the effort. Below are sources and tools to help you finish your work without using GenAI.
