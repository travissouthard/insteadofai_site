    <h3 id="why-not">Why not use generative AI?</h3>
    <p>
        Large Language Models and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence"
            target="_blank">generative AI</a> (GenAI) tech have become seemingly pervasive in the last few years.
        They have been developed to write just about anything and generate images and video. While this may seem like a
        convenience and a productivity tool, they have shown themselves to <a
            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41032-5" target="_blank">not really</a> <a
            href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/lawyer-cited-6-fake-cases-made-up-by-chatgpt-judge-calls-it-unprecedented/"
            target="_blank">be worth it</a>. Artists, writers, and programmers have largely found these frustrating
        because they have led to layoffs, fewer sales, or theft of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides using much more power than conventional methods to do tasks, at best <a
            href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/29/hobbesian-slop/" target="_blank">GenAI just makes slop</a>. The
        outputs are often not good and need clean up work to make ready for publishing. But even if it was consistently
        making publishable things, the biggest issue still stands:

            Why should I bother reading something that nobody could be bothered to write?

    <p>
        <a href="#tools">Making stuff</a> is fun and rewarding, but also often tedious and difficult. The second part is
        especially true when making things for a living. In those cases, <a href="#hire">commissioning an expert</a> or
        finding a <a href="#tools">ready-to-use element</a> can accomplish the goal of helping finish the task with less
        work. Hiring someone can be expensive and even stock photos cost some money, but it also means someone gets paid
        for the work they did to help you finish yours.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you're working on a personal project or just making something because you want it to exist, then the fun
        and rewarding feeling will likely justify the tedium and difficulty. Putting in the work and practice is very
        often worth the effort. Let's go over what you can do instead of AI:
    </p>
    <h3 id="sources">Use open access media</h3>
    <p>Stock images and video libraries are a great source, but this resource will focus on free public resources. Each
        source has its own policy on use and reuse, and should especially be reviewed for commercial uses.</p>

    <h3 id="tools">Make it yourself</h3>
    <p>
        If you need something specific and can't find it in the above sources, making it yourself is a great option.
        This option can mean learning or honing a skill, but that is almost always worth it. There are certainly other
        tools (sometimes with better user experience), but this resource will focus on free tools.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>: Image manipulation tool. Great for collage and
            photo editing, okay for drawing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>: 3D modeling, drawing, animation, video
            editing. A very robust tool but has a steep learning curve. There is a good community for <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z">learning</a> though.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/" target="_blank">Piskel App</a>: An easy to use but limited web editor
            for making pixel art images and animations.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also draw or collage a tangible image and photograph or scan it (libraries and copyshops can help).
            This needs some care and time to make work well, but your project is likely worth the effort.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="hire">Hire an expert</h3>
    <p>
        There are loads of people who are offering services for drawing, painting, photography, video editing,
        copywriting, and just about anything you need to complete your project. These workers have different styles and
        skill levels, so you should certainly review their previous work to ensure it will be the right fit.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are quite a few platforms to connect artists and writers to those who want to commission them. Some are
        certainly better than others and you should try a few. Even if you find a good plaform, try to be aware of
        others since platforms decay and other users may move on to other platforms when they do.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>And pay them what they ask and on time.</b> They helped you finish your project. They deserve to be paid for
        that work. Your project not making money is no excuse. If it's your project, you take on the risk. Pay your
        vendors.
    </p>
    <h3 id="faq">Yeah but...</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>GenAI is democratizing art</summary>
        <p>
            No it's not. Anyone can make art at (almost) any time with a littany of different media and materials.
            Artists are not hoarding art, they just practiced a lot and want to be paid for their work. Also with all
            the public domain and creative commons work available, art is already very available to the people.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>The public domain works don't fit what I need</summary>
        <p>
            This is fair actually. There is a limit to what is in the public domain for sure, though more is added all
            the time. Remixing elements from different works can sometimes lead to the aesthetic you may be looking for.
            But if you don't want to remix something, you can always commission someone.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Commissioning someone is too expensive</summary>
        <p>
            Yes, it often is, but it is also often well worth it. Artists and writers typically <em>dramatically
                undercharge</em> for their services and are still told they're too expensive. There are times when it is
            worth your time and money to hire an expert who can deliver what you need much faster (and likely better)
            than if you did it yourself. If you can't or don't want to pay for a commission, you can certainly make it
            yourself.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>I don't know how to make it myself</summary>
        <p>
            That's okay. Typically, no one is good at any skill if they aren't practicing regularly. The above tools
            have strong communities with many tutorials on how to use them, tips on procuring better tools, and
            discussions on how to improve your skills. If you're making something you want to publish, it helps to
            practice by doing it small and in low detail a few times before making the actual piece.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>I don't have time to make it myself</summary>
        <p>
            That is the rub. Being less practiced at something often means you will take longer to make the same thing
            as someone who is well-practiced. This is very normal. If you have a deadline, great! That will set some
            limits on how you finish your project. Limits make us make choices about what is vital to the project and
            often the project benefits from this. Sometimes these limits mean we need to hire an expert.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>I don't <em>want</em> to make it myself</summary>
        <p>
            If you want something to exist, you may need to make it yourself. If you don't want to make something, that
            may be a sign you don't <em>really</em> want it to exist. That's okay. Not all of our ideas are worth
            pursuing. It's better to start something and learn this early in the process.

        <summary>AI is getting better! It's the future!</summary>
        <p>
            GenAI is not the future. It will likely fade like other tech fads like NFTs, the Metaverse, many JavaScript
            frameworks, and 3D televisions. Even in the world of AI, there are many things we've called AI in the past
            that we don't consider AI anymore, and GenAI will likely join them. There are also arguments to say that <a

                target="_blank">GenAI is not really getting that much better</a> for the effort being put in.
